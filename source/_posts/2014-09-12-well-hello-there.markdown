My name is Alex. This is my very first post and I couldn't be more excited. This blog will be a record of my quest for code literacy. In between, I might even throw in some wildcard content! Like a media server guide, or an op ed!

I've been going HAM on [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/). And frankly, it's been very challenging but in the best way possible. And now having a bit of HTML, CSS, and Java under my belt - I'll be focusing primarily on Ruby going forward.

In addition to keeping track of my coding trials and tribulations, I'm also really looking forward to documenting some of my thoughts on technology. Let's do this!
